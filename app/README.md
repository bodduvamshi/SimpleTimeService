SimpleTimeService — Minimal DevOps Challenge Application
Purpose:

SimpleTimeService is a minimal microservice created as part of the Particle41 DevOps Team Challenge.
It demonstrates:

Basic web application development

Containerization using Docker

Running applications as a non-root user inside containers

Publishing images to a public registry (Docker Hub)

Documentation and clear setup instructions

The service exposes one endpoint:

GET /
{
  "timestamp": "<current date and time>",
  "ip": "<visitor ip>"
}

SimpleTimeService/
├── app/
│   ├── main.py
│   ├── requirements.txt
│   └── Dockerfile
└── README.md


All application code and Dockerfile are located inside the app/ directory as recommended.

Prerequisites:

To run or deploy this application, you need the following tools (on a local laptop OR any cloud VM like AWS EC2(I used)):

1. Git

Download: https://git-scm.com/downloads

sudo apt install git -y


2. Python 3

Download: https://www.python.org/downloads/

3. Docker Engine (Linux) / Docker Desktop (Windows/Mac)

Docker Desktop: https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/

Docker Engine (Linux): https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/

Command

sudo apt update -y
sudo apt install docker.io -y
sudo systemctl enable docker
sudo systemctl start docker
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER


4. Docker Hub Account

Create free account: https://hub.docker.com/signup

Cloning the Repository:

Clone the repo to your laptop or EC2 instance:

https://github.com/bodduvamshi/SimpleTimeService.git

cd SimpleTimeService/app/

Running the App Locally (Optional)

Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


Run the application:

python3 main.py


Access in browser:

http://localhost:8080/

🐳 Docker Instructions

The application is fully Dockerized and runs as a non-root user inside the container as required.

✔ 1. Build Docker Image

From inside the app/ directory:

docker build -t simpletimeservice:latest .

✔ 2. Run the Container

docker run -p 8080:8080 simpletimeservice:latest


Test in browser:

http://localhost:8080/


OR if running on EC2:

http://<EC2-PUBLIC-IP>:8080/  (make sure to include inbound ports 22, 80, 8080 while creation security group)

Publish to Docker Hub (I did as Required for Task)
1. Login to Docker Hub

docker login

2. Tag your image

docker tag simpletimeservice:latest <your-dockerhub-username>/simpletimeservice:latest

3. Push the image

docker push <your-dockerhub-username>/simpletimeservice:latest


You should now see the image on:

https://hub.docker.com/repositories

Pulling the Image for Testing

Anyone can run your app using:

docker pull vamshiboddu/simpletimeservice:latest
docker run -p 8080:8080 vamshiboddu/simpletimeservice:latest


Open:

http://localhost:8080/


Or:

http://<cloud-vm-ip>:8080/

Security Notes

No secrets or credentials are stored in the repository.

The app inside the container runs as a non-root user for security best test practices.

Docker image is kept minimal — only required dependencies included.
